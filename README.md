# TRPG
This is to assist GM to set up an TRPG game not that I really know the rules of TRPG though.

# Planning to do list
* Complete database linking of weapon
* Item inventory for character
  * Set up weapon equipping
  * Test character weapon display (weapon skill shows up in skill etc...)
* Set up battle page
  * Skill rolling for when skill is being use.
  * Quick hp modification as well as other stat maybe
